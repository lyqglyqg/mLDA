Multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis with Ultrahigh-Dimensional Features

Name: mLDA-package Alias: mLDA-package

Title: Multi-class linear discriminant analysis with ultrahigh-dimensional features


Description: The mLDA package implements the multi-class linear discriminant analysis method for classifications with ultrahigh-dimensional data. The method can select both marginally and jointly informative features that are informative for classifications.

Details: The package mLDA conducts a variable selection and a multi-class classification for ultrahigh-dimensional features. The mLDA can select both the marginally informative features and the marginally uninformative but jointly informative features.
